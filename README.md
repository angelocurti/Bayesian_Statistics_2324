# Bayesian_Statistics_2324
This repository contains all the material related to the bayesian statistics course project "Variational Inference for Dirichlet Process Mixtures and Beyond" for the academic year 2023-2024.
## Folders ##
### GaussianMixtureModel ###
In this folder is stored all the material related to the first part of our project where we implement a Variational Inference algorithm for Gaussian mixture models and we compare its perfomance and quality with respect to the classical MCMC method.
#### code ####
In this folder are stored all the code files written in PYTHON
#### notebooks ####
In this folder are located notebook files that, compared to the code files, delve deeper into the theoretical aspects of the model and present in a more precise manner all the steps of the various algorithms.
### DPMixtureModel ###
In this folder is stored all the material related to the second part of our project where we implement a Variational Inference algorithm for Dirichlet Process mixture models and we compare its perfomance and quality with respect to the classical MCMC method.
### IBP ###
In this folder is stored all the material related to the third part of our project where we implement a Variational Inference algorithm for Indian Buffet Process model both in finite and infinite dimension.
### Materials ###
In this folder you can find a report summarizing our work plus mid-term and final presentations.
